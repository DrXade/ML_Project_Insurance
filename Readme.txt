Develop a regresion model using the insurance.csv dataset to predict charges. 
Evaluate the model's accuracy with the R-Squares Score.
Then apply the model to estimate predicted_charges for unseen data validation_dataset.csv


Build a regression model to predict charges using insurance.csv dataset.
Evaluate the R-Squared Score of your trained model and save it as a variable called r2_score.
The model's success will be assessed based on this R-Squared Score,which must exceed a threshold of 0.65


Use the trained model to predict charges for the data in validation_dataset.csv
Store the predictions as a new column in the validation dataset called predicted_charges, saving as a 
pandas DataFrame called validation_date. If needed, handle
